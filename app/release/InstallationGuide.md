# Installing the APK on an Android Device

1. Enable Installation of Unknown Apps
    
    Because this APK is being installed manually and not from the Play Store, your device will flag 
    it for being insecure. You must enable installing unknown applications using a file manager 
    application. 'My Files' is a native file manager application, although you may user a different 
    file manager of your choice. Enable it by following:

        'Settings' > 'Apps' > 'Special Access' > 'Install unknown apps' > and enabling 'My Files'

    Alternatively, you can find this by typing in 'unknown apps' in the search bar at the top of the 
    settings menu.

2. Download the APK file to your PC and locate it.

3. Connect your Android device to your PC via USB.

4. Open the file explorer of your Android device select the location you want the APK file to go.

5. Drag and drop the APK file from your PC to the directory you've chosen in your Android device.

    You may now unplug your device from your PC.

6. On your Android device, using the file manager application that you enabled (ex: 'My Files'), 
    browse to the directory that you dropped the APK file into from your PC. Tap the APK file.

7. It will ask you if you want to install this app. Select 'Install.'

8. It may pop up a message like, "Unsafe app blocked." Tap 'More details' > 'Install anyway'
